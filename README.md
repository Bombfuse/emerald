## Lite

A fully featured 2D engine with minimal dependencies.

## Powerful

An easy to learn API that gives you everything you need to build a game.

### ECS

Emerald uses the [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) paradigm for creating, managing, and updating game entities.

Emerald uses [Legion](https://github.com/TomGillen/legion) under the hood for extremely fast entity iteration, and a remarkably clean query API.
